*Code used to analyse data for the HELCATS-FLARECAST paper*

This repository contains the code and data used to compare the EU FP7 HELCATS and EU H2020 FLARECAST databases for the Solar Physics publication, Connecting Coronal Mass Ejections to Their Solar Active Region Sources: Combining Results from the HELCATS and FLARECAST Projects (doi: 10.1007/s11207-018-1287-4).

Code
-------
lowcat_plots.py was written by S. A. Murray and includes code to create Figures 2 - ?.
LOWCAT database is available at https://figshare.com/articles/HELCATS_LOWCAT/4970222. Extra data from the FLARECAST database needed to run the code is also provided in /data/? This is the FLARECAST API as of Octiber 2017 ().

The LOWCAT algoritm itself is at:

HELC_FL_TS.py and HELCATS_match_FLARECAST_1.py was written by J. A. Guerra and includes code to create Figures ? -?.

It is worth noting that Figure 1 was created by running the SMART algorithm developed by P. A. Higgins, and IDL code which is also available on GitHub. A newer python version is also now available here.
